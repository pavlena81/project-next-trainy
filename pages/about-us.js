                Meet Maria, a passionate lover of roses and gardens who dreams of
                creating a beautiful park for people in Ukraine. Maria has always
                been fascinated by the beauty and fragrance of roses, and she spends
                most of her free time tending to her own rose garden.
                Over time, Maria began to dream of creating a beautiful park for people
                in Ukraine where they could come and admire the beauty of roses and other
                flowers. She imagined a park with winding paths, tranquil ponds, and carefully
                manicured gardens filled with a wide variety of roses, each one carefully
                chosen for its beauty and fragrance.She believes that by sharing her love of roses
                and gardens with others, she can help to create a more beautiful and harmonious world.
